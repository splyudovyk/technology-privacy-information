            <p>
                The advertisement above was created by the campaign of Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis to disparage his opponent, Donald Trump, in the 2024 Republican Party presidential primary. The ad, which was shared on Twitter, criticizes the fact that Trump did not fire Former Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite claiming to draw a contrast between ‚Äúreality TV Trump,‚Äù who fired countless people, and ‚Äúreal-life Trump,‚Äù who did not fire Fauci, the ad uses several images of Trump hugging and kissing Fauci that were generated by artificial intelligence (AI) as ‚Äúreal-life evidence‚Äù of Trump‚Äôs supposed misplaced trust in or close relationship with Fauci. These fake images are shown alongside real photographs of the two at around the 0:25 timestamp (the top left, bottom middle, and bottom right images are fake), being presented as if they are real. Only Twitter, rather than the campaign itself, has labeled the images as AI-generated and potentially misleading, suggesting the campaign is intentionally deceiving viewers.
            </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, due to the rise of the Internet and social media like Twitter, this kind of misinformation can now spread far more quickly and easily than it could have before the development of these technologies. Social media is inherently reliant upon people‚Äôs short attention spans, with users quickly reading and scrolling past short pieces of content. As a result, creating believable misinformation is far simpler because viewers rarely take the time to think critically about or fact check what they‚Äôve just seen.
            </p>
            <p>
                Misinformation about people, in particular, has also become a lot easier due to the development of AI programs that can generate realistic images of people in various situations, including those that may damage public opinion of them or detract from their message. This ad, for instance, attempts to insinuate that Trump is weak or not as Republican as he says because he failed to fire Fauci, who many Republicans view as too Democratic. That could potentially artificially damage what people who see the ad think about Trump, causing them to draw conclusions based on false information and possibly spread the untrue claims even further.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, this artifact was selected because, unfortunately, this type of technology has become incredibly accessible
                and easy to weaponize. Beyond just sharing private details of a person‚Äôs life, it allows people to invent details
                and share them as if they are reality. Unlike many other technologies, which raise privacy concerns due to the spread of real personal data, this creates an entirely new problem area never before seen to this extent, threatening privacy on the basis of fake personal data. After all, being able to provide ‚Äúphotographic evidence‚Äù of something with generated images is much more convincing than simply making a comment or statement about it, and, as the AI-generated images become more realistic and social media becomes more widespread, creating and sharing this misinformation is becoming increasingly easier. In today‚Äôs political and social climate, this technological development makes disparaging others far simpler, and, although the technology is not fully developed yet, with people who look more closely being able to tell the differences between AI-generated images and real images, this can and should serve as a warning for the future.
