            <figcaption><em>Artifact: Amazon Alexa Smart Home Device, Amazon Echo</em></figcaption>
            <p>
                The Amazon Alexa is a virtual assistant released in 2014 that was based on a Polish speech synthesizer called Inova that was bought by Amazon in
                2013. Initially, Amazon used the Alexa in its Amazon Echo smart speaker, which is the artifact shown above, but it has since been incorporated into
                smartwatches, Kindles, and so on. The smart speaker in particular was designed to be a hands-free device that users could control via voice
                commands, such as asking it a question to search online, asking for the weather, or asking it to play music. Notably, as the device has become
                more advanced, it’s also become more interconnected with other devices; for instance, users can now connect Alexa to lights in their home and use it to turn them on and
                off with their voice.

            </p>
            <p>
                On the surface, this seems like a positive development that makes life more convenient—you can now control virtually any device with an Alexa,
                from lights to door locks to thermostats to cameras. However, because the device is voice-controlled, it constantly listens for the wakeword “Alexa,” potentially recording and 
                storing speech and pieces of private conversations. Although Amazon only officially stores anything said after the wakeword, even this can pose a major problem as words similar to “Alexa,”
                such as “extra” or “ketchup,” may be detected as the wakeword, with speech following these being stored. This means that an Alexa
                can potentially be triggered during a conversation about sensitive information, storing this information in the cloud without a person realizing.



            </p>
            <p>
                However, the data collected by Alexas goes beyond just simple voice recordings. The devices also gather information about user preferences,
                search histories, and the way different people’s voices sound. In fact, Alexas are able to analyze voices of different members of the same
                household and individualize preferences based on who is speaking. In order to be personalized in such a way, large amounts of very specific data need to be stored, and these can provide shockingly accurate insight into individuals’ behaviors, interests, routines, and so on. Unfortunately, regardless of Amazon’s security, there is always a risk of data breaches and of data being mishandled or shared without proper consent, and, in the wrong hands, this data can be used to target people, whether for advertising or for more malicious purposes.


            </p>

            <p>
                Additionally, users are able to use “skills” through Alexas, which function similarly to apps on a smartphone and are created by third-party
                developers, not Amazon itself. Amazon does not necessarily require these third-party “skill” applications to have secure privacy policies
                before making them available via devices like the Amazon Echo, and researchers have found that over 20% of skills that request access to sensitive data have
                nonexistent or misleading privacy policies. This means that, on top of Amazon storing some personal data, some third-party applications and developers also have access to private information, and these third parties tend to be more prone to breaches of security, with some even selling users’ data.

            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, this artifact was chosen because it is a prime example of the conflict between convenience and privacy that has
                risen out of modern day technological advancement. While being able to automate actions like turning on the lights or using
                various “skills” via voice commands is certainly easy and convenient, this also poses broader security risks due to voice data
                and conversations being recorded, stored, and shared with third parties that may mishandle the data. Additionally, the
                personalization through artificially intelligent models and devices can be very enjoyable and helpful for users, but it
                also involves the use and analysis of data that can be used to relatively easily identify people. Individuals therefore
                need to use these smart home devices cautiously, remaining aware of the potential risks of giving them personal information.
