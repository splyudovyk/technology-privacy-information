            <p>
                The Cambridge Analytics Data Scandal was a major controversy in 2018 regarding the use of Facebook users’ private data by a data analytics firm called Cambridge Analytica. The firm utilized an app called “This is Your Digital Life,” which users had to log into with their Facebook accounts and which included a series of personality-related questions, including the personality quiz in the artifact above. About 270,000 individuals actually took this quiz, and, by asking users to log in, the company was able to tie people’s answers to their Facebook accounts, constructing psychological profiles on them. Beyond that, the firm was able to exploit Facebook’s “friend” feature by gathering data from quiz-takers’ profiles about their “friends,” thus obtaining information on some 50 million people in total. All of this information was then used to build voter profiles and target individuals with personalized political advertisements, specifically in support of the 2016 Donald Trump campaign.

            </p>
            <p>
                This kind of privacy breach was only possible as a result of the development of the Internet and social media. To many, data shared on social media sites feels more anonymous than data shared in person, making people more careless about giving out their information online. Clicking a button to, for instance, log into an app with a social media profile in order to take a fun quiz may seem safe and harmless, but the reality is that even that can have unintended consequences. With this form of entertainment becoming so widespread, users run the risk of accidentally giving their information to people who will use it for malicious purposes.

            </p>
            <p>This scandal also shows how much information social media companies actually have about people. As these applications and websites become more well-known and popular, increasingly more people are joining them and thus sometimes unknowingly handing over personal information. After all, essentially everything users do online is stored, and this data can be used to create extremely accurate profiles about users’ interests, location, and so on.

            </p>
            <p>
                This technology also changes the nature of advertising, with targeted advertising based on user information becoming possible. For instance, in the Cambridge Analytica Scandal, advertisements were targeted based on Facebook profile info, such as location, and quiz answers, which allowed for the creation of advertisements based on different personality types, including whether someone was introverted or extroverted, how emotional they were, and so on. This targeting tends to be much more effective than the generic advertising used in the past as it preys on people’s psychology, exploiting their personal beliefs and fears to influence them. This makes it an incredibly powerful tool and weapon that can influence major events like elections, potentially swaying voters in the direction of a particular candidate (e.g., in this scandal’s case, in favor of Trump).

            </p>
            <p>
                Thus, this artifact was chosen because it shows how powerful information shared on the Internet can be and why data
                privacy and security matter. With the development of technology like social media, getting and abusing this kind of
                information is becoming increasingly easier for companies, and the Cambridge Analytica Scandal shows the real-world
                impacts this can have. One individual’s information alone may not seem that important, but, when combined with millions
                of other people’s information, it can change the course of the country and the world.
