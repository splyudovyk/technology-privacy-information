            <figcaption><em>Artifact: RESTRICT Act Document</em></figcaption>
            <p>
                This artifact is the Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats that Risk Information and Communications Technology (RESTRICT) Act of 2023, which is a bipartisan bill that was introduced by Virginia Senator Mark Warner on March 7, 2023. The bill’s stated purpose is to limit risks to national security by allowing the US Department of Commerce to more tightly control and regulate transactions involving foreign information and communications technology (ICT). This would effectively allow the government to ban or force the sale of a variety of softwares and technologies (e.g., gaming apps, payment apps) if they have over 1 million US users and are from “foreign adversaries,” including China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, and Venezuela.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike the other artifacts in this museum, this isn’t a technological development itself, but rather a governmental response to the developments. Interestingly, the Act actually has strong bipartisan support, with the need for increased data security being one of the only topics that both the Democratic and Republican parties seem to agree on.

            </p>
            <p>
                The sheer strength of this response is telling of the level of privacy risk the US government feels that new technology can pose, especially in the wrong hands, and it almost seems like they are afraid of losing control of their citizens’ information, both to the individuals themselves or to other governments. After all, due to the rise of technology and its facilitation of globalization, people across the world have become increasingly more interconnected, with friends and family members on the other side of the world being just a phone call or video chat away, regardless of physical borders or space. While this can be good for individuals, it gives the US government less power over the types of communications started and maintained with citizens of other nations. It also makes it much easier for foreign companies and governments to obtain and use US citizens’ information. This is because many US citizens use websites and applications created abroad to communicate with those in other countries, including WeChat for China and Viber Media for many slavic countries, and, by sharing personal information and data through these platforms, the data can potentially be intercepted and used by foreign governments to the detriment of the US.

            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, due to how quickly technologies and platforms like this have developed, the government hasn’t really been able to keep up with the rapid changes, and they are now trying to regulate what they can to make up for potential breaches or risks. For instance, Congressional hearings were recently held regarding banning TikTok, a very widely used platform that has skyrocketed in popularity over the past few years, due to the alleged privacy risk it poses as a result of its supposed connections to the Chinese government. Through bans like this, the US government wants to halt the increased spread of information that has resulted from the development and use of TikTok and similar apps, attempting to stop other governments from exploiting the increased availability of US users’ online data.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, the RESTRICT Act was chosen as an artifact because it provides a different perspective on the impact of
                technological development, specifically from the viewpoint of the US government, which wants to maintain control
                over its citizens’ information. They seem almost scared of what these technological developments could mean, and
                their reaction is to try to restrict the sharing of valuable personal information with other nations by monitoring and
                regulating communication as they see fit. In essence, they want to be the only ones with access to and control over their own
                citizens' data.
                Thus, while the RESTRICT Act has not yet been passed, it certainly changes
                the narrative on information sharing, making personal privacy in the digital age a matter of national security.
