                <p>Considering all of the artifacts displayed in this museum,
                    how has the rapid development of technology and the digital age affected privacy and the spread of information?
                </p>

        <section class="main-article">
            <p>
                With the development of technology and the digital age, people have become increasingly interconnected, and information has become more and more easily accessible through the Internet. While this can be positive in some cases, with people having quicker access to information like news, it also means that people’s personal data are more readily available and faster to obtain, which poses a number of new risks not seen before on the same scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                With millions of smart home technologies and devices like Amazon’s virtual assistant Alexa in homes across the US,
                private conversations and information about people’s voices, preferences, and potentially sensitive topics are at
                risk of being recorded and stored, at times by third parties. The way this information is stored and shared effectively
                commodifies people’s personal data, with companies wanting access to it and even using it to make a profit. As these
                technologies become more commonplace, maintaining security becomes far more difficult, with people no longer even being
                able to rely on “the privacy of their own homes.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond data simply recorded by technology without people really being aware of it, people have also become far more willing to simply give out their information online in a way they wouldn’t have done in person, believing that it is anonymous or cannot be used maliciously. Most people, for instance, have probably taken a personality quiz at some point in their life, and these just seem like a fun form of entertainment, but, when combined with something like a social media profile, which can include a person’s name and demographic information, it can be used to construct a scarily accurate psychological profile. Unfortunately, this can be used to target them in a far more personalized way, like in the Cambridge Analytica Scandal, than general advertising before the digital age, taking advantage of and playing into what they feel and believe, which can have major consequences (e.g., by influencing elections) on a large scale. People should thus be far more wary than they currently are about giving websites or applications information like their social media accounts or personality data.
            </p>
            <p>
                On top of this private information being taken and abused, the development of technology like artificial intelligence
                (AI) means that personal data can be fabricated and spread as if it is real. Not only is this misinformation
                more believable and easier to make due to the creation and use of AI (e.g., the DeSantis campaign’s AI-generated
                images of Trump), but it is also easier to share through the Internet and social media, where people can see it and
                “repost" it in a matter of seconds. People therefore need to start thinking more critically about what they see
                online because, just like real personal information, this false information can have massive consequences if
                people believe it to be accurate and spread it widely. In fact, like targeted advertising based on real private data, it can influence public opinion on the national and international levels.
            </p>
            <p>
                Notably, these changes and developments have not gone unnoticed by the US government. Leaders worry about what
                these technologies, especially mobile apps like social media, and their collection of user data can mean for
                national security. They have reacted strongly, including through the proposal of the RESTRICT Act, which would give
                them the power to regulate widely-used technologies from nations considered to be threats (e.g., China), because they don't want
                their citizens' data in what they feel are the wrong hands. After all, in the digital age, with information being so accessible, companies are not the only entities who want power over people’s information—countries do, too—and it’s truly telling of the power of personal data that it is considered a national security risk for other countries to have it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, the digital age and the development of social media, AI, and more has completely changed the information landscape.
                Now, more than ever before, keeping information about oneself, whether it be real or fake, private and out of the public eye
                is incredibly difficult. Yet, these artifacts show that this kind of personal information is extremely valuable, with companies
                and governments alike trying to maintain control of it, and this is only going to increase in the future. People thus need to start
                being far more careful about what they say and do with technology because, as it becomes more advanced, nearly everything can be
                traced back to or used to target them, which could shape public opinion, impacting national and international affairs.
