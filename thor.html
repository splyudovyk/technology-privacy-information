                    <p>This artifact is an advertisement from 1945 for the Thor Automagic Washer, a two-in-one washer that could wash both
                    clothes and dishes. The product had two easily interchangeable tubs and could operate without much work required from
                    the user. The Automagic Washer was a revolutionary machine that combined two relatively new technologies into a compact
                    and efficient device.
                    </p>
                    <p>Although early washing machines and dishwashers were developed back in the 1800s, they continued to evolve greatly over
                    time. By the early 1900s, they started to resemble the technology we are familiar with today. In the 1920s and 30s, the
                    dishwasher could be connected to a plumbing system and was small enough for the average home. By the 1940s, they gained
                    electrical elements for a drying feature. During the same time period, washing machines also made great advancements. In
                    1911, the Whirlpool Corporation began the production of electric motor-driven wringer washers. The first automatic
                    washing machine with a built-in timer was not developed until 1937 by Bendix Home Appliances. In the 1940s, Thor decided
                    to combine the two technologies to develop the Automagic Washer, a machine that could wash both dishes and clothes.

                        Home appliances like the Thor Automagic Washer could save families a lot of time and make people's lives much easier.
                        These machines could be used by pretty much anyone and did not require much work to operate. In addition, laundromats
                        started to become more popular in the 1940s. Coined by Westinghouse Electric in 1940, a laundromat was a service where
                        people could easily get their clothes washed without having to own a personal washing machine. Other businesses like
                        restaurants and hotels were also able to benefit from the time and cost-saving aspects of this technology.

                In particular, the dishwasher and washing machine had a large impact on women, since they took on most of the household
                responsibilities at the time. These machines made household chores much easier, giving women time for other tasks like
                joining the workforce and contributing to the economy.

            </p>
            <p>
                Although women were not completely liberated from their traditional household roles, they were given a lot more freedom
                to do what they wanted. This also allowed many women to partake in politics and speak out for themselves. As more women
                participated in campaigns, they helped several movements progress, and not just the women's rights movement. Some of the 
                women that flooded into the workforce joined labor unions and demanded fair pay and better conditions, while others advocated 
                for equality and minority rights.  Over time, the washing machine and dishwasher continued to grow in
                popularity, and people started to change the way they thought about the roles of women.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the Automagic Washer eventually faded from the market, it represented all the incredible advancements in
                dishwasher and washing machine technology. The development of these appliances made life for Americans much easier and
                would eventually become a staple in all households. These innovations gave women more opportunities and eventually paved
                the way for the women's rights movement.
